# Classify-Skin-Cancer-isic-challenge
This project is part of the ISIC Challenge for skin cancer classification. It uses deep learning with EfficientNetB3 to classify images as cancerous or non-cancerous. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, with data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques to improve performance.
